AS Monitoring and Alerting
=======================================

Open-Source Stack
------------

We provide a ready-to-use setup to monitor SCION ASes that run the open-source SCION stack. To setup monitoring for your AS, please contact marten.gartner@ovgu.de.

The setup will be provided as a single archive file. After extracting the archive on your local computer, follow the guidelines in the readme.md to install the monitoring client on your AS and the monitoring server on a dedicated machine (we recommend to not install the monitoring server on the same machine(s) that run the SCION AS).
